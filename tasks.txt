#new Add nav-sidebar from which you can create new tasks

Probably on the right side. Might interfere with page scroll bar.
For easy creation of new tasks. Always visible?
OR
You can click one of the current tasks and gives the options to create
a new one next to it/in front of/last/first. Much smoother..
With keyboard functionality? ctrl+enter? or just enter?
